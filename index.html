        <p>Hey there! I'm Tshegofatso and I'm a die hard fan of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Lamar" class="link"><b>Kendrick Lamar</b></a> . Ever since I heard the song "Money-Trees", I love how he uses metaphors , similes in his songs to intrigue the mind. He talks about issues & socio-issues we face on a daily as human beings. He also taps into the culture of black people. <em><b><a href="https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Trees" target="_blank" class="link">"Money Trees"</a></b></em>. In this article, I'll be discussing some of my favourite songs and of course the controversial history in the making diss tracks . Let me not keep you waiting and let's get into it!!!</p>

         <h1 class="heading">Favourite Song</h1>

      <p>I love the beat of this song, the instruments and chorus always have me repeating it over and over again.
         Money-trees was released in 2012 but it never ages, Kendrick never released the music of this song which makes it more unique however he featured Jay Rock on this song.</p>

        <p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(Kendrick_Lamar_song)" class="link" target="_blank">Euphoria</a></b> is a diss track that Kendrick Lamar released in a rap battle against Drake. It shook up the Hip-hop industry and of course the internet.
          "This diss track was written and recorded by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, in response to Drake's single "Push Ups" and his independently released song "Taylor Made Freestyle".
           It was unexpectedly released on April 30, 2024, via Interscope Records, initially as a YouTube exclusive before being released to streaming platforms hours later.

        <p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6:16_in_LA" target="_blank" class="link ">6:16 in L.A</a></b>Kendrick Lamar dropped “6:16 in LA,” the most musically satisfying—and, despite its narrower focus, most personally incisive—volley yet in his beef with Drake. 
            Coopting the Canadian’s strategy of hitting an opponent with two disses before receiving one response, Kendrick eschews the chintzy Boxden-core of “Push Ups” and “euphoria” for a breezy but melancholic Al Green flip that gives the record a welcome air of big-brother condescension. 
        </br>
    </br>
            And when the wire transfers are dangled over Kendrick’s old acquaintances, there’s simply nothing to give.
             “You started to put money in the streets,” he raps, “then lost money ’cause they came back with no receipts/I’m sorry that I live a boring life, I like peace.”</p>

        <p><b><a href="https://genius.com/Kendrick-lamar-meet-the-grahams-lyrics" target="_blank" class="link">Meet the Grahams</a></b><a href="https://medium.com/@kevanamonhudson/kendrick-lamar-meet-the-grahams-6-16-euphoria-analyrical-content-07f75e6c989" target="_blank" class="link">Grahams</a></em></b>. “Meet the Grahams” arrived very shortly after Drake accused Dot of domestic violence and infidelity in “Family Matters” on Friday night. The similarity in the subject matter (and titles) of the two songs suggests that Dot might have already known “Family Matters” was going to come out, so he prepared “Meet the Grahams” in advance.

None of the allegations on either side have been verified with concrete evidence or receipts, but before another diss track drops, here’s a full breakdown of everything Kendrick Lamar said about Drake while addressing each of his immediate family members on “Meet The Grahams.”</p>

        <p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X%26Y" target="_blank" class="link">Not Like Us</a></b>b The rap feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar long ago passed the point of no return.
             It’s now total war for these superstars, and Kendrick has dropped another nuke in the form of “Not Like Us,” which comes on the heels of “meet the grahams,” which he just released last night after Drake gave us “Family Matters.” This time around, Kendrick doubles down on his claims that Drake likes young women and straight up calls him a pedophile. (The single artwork shows Drake’s mansion as it would look on a sex-offender map.)

      <p>I personally think these beef/diss tracks are part of hip hop history. They created uproar worldwide, and debates about the culture as much as it was a nasty rap battle it got people debating. 
        It created conversations all over the world, it got people dancing but however it got people picking sides.</p>
